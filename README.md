# Developers-Environment
What does environment of a developer look like?

Currently these are the tools which I encounter almost daily.

Integrated Development Editor

1. VSCode
2. Intellij

Runtime Environment

1. JDK/ JRE for java projects
2. Node/ npm for Node.js projects
3. Anaconda for python projects

Source Control Tools

1. Git
2. Github Desktop

Tips

1. If you have already installed Anaconda, always use Anaconda prompt for installing new packages, instead of Windows command prompt. The reason is that, if you have a python installed before installing Anaconda, there will be conflicts.
